# General Assembly - Project 5

## Project Name: Budgeting app

## Project Overview
This is the fifth project assignment for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. This is my final project. This will be financial - budgeting app to create your personal budget  and track your incomes and expences.

### Description aka User's Story
My budgeting app will allow users to signup or login into his/her account. The user will be able to create his income/expense and then see reflection in his wallets. The user can track his money flow throw his wallets. The user will also be able to update a income/expense and delete it.

Here are the requirements: 

##### A RESTful JSON API
- Must have an Rails server exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
- Must have a PostgreSQL database with at least three tables: 1 user table and at least two others of your choice. There must be at least 1 pair of associated tables (one to many, many to many, etc.)
- Must use Active Record to define models for interacting with the database.
- Must have each of the generic controller actions (Index, Show, Create, Update, Delete) between the two non-user models.
- Must use Rails Routes to organize your route endpoints.
##### A front-end that consumes your own API
- Permit the user to perform Index, Show, Create, Update, and Delete actions only if they are logged in.
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS. Remember to use Grid and Flexbox!
- Use Semantic UI for styling
- Use React Router for client side routing.

### App Components	
* CREATE - User will be able to create a income/expense 
* READ - Users will be able to view all of his incomes/expenses and reports 
* UPDATE - will be able to update a income/expense 
* DELETE - will be able to delete a income/expense 

### Technologies Being Used:
For this project, we will be using Ruby on Rails, Postgres, React,  Semantic UI , Canvas.js , D3.js . 

An explanation of the major challenges expected while building this app and how you foresee your team solving them:
- Implementing Rails as a back-end -
    Solution: Referring to past labs with Rails
- Implementing React as a front-end -
    Solution: Referring to past labs with React
- Deploying to Heroku and Surge -
    Solution: Working as a class to deploy on Friday
- Using libraries such as Semantic UI, Canvas.js, D3.js -
    Solution: Watch videos, Search in Google, Search in Stack Overflow

### MVP
* Auth, Log in, Sign up
* Create new operation
* READ all operations 
* Update operations
* Delete operation 

### Post MVP
* D3 , Canvas.js , Styling with graphs
* Categorized by cash and credit
* Currency differantiation
* Implement Limits for app
* Implement Prioraty for Expenses
* Search operation (income/expense) based on name/user/cuisine type/ingredients
* Improve CSS
* Implement Budgeting API
* Comments
* Refactor code
